# Googe-form-Access-Control-Using-Wifi
ðŸš€ Google Form Access Control Using WiFi is a Flask-based web application that restricts access to a Google Form based on the user's IP address. It ensures that only users connected to a specific WiFi network (e.g., 192.168.1.x subnet) can access the form, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized submissions.
